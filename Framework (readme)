The idea that I have for the framework of setting up the interface is relatively simple
A method generates an array of "Items" that we will work from; Extracting them from the database and copying them to something that the program itself is able to work with.
The array will be loaded onto the method itself that shows the items on a frame made for it; which will follow the following structure:
On North/Up, a toolbar that shows various tools for helping with searching; A filter that divides by Videogames, Boardgames, and Music, as a checkbox that can be had for either (And all mutually exclusive)
Aside that, there should be a search bar, that allows you to search by titles that contain the words that you're using. A bit simplified, but it should work
Needless to say, there should be a "Refresh" button that helps you see the result of what the filtered search would be, using those different options.
On the middle of the page, maybe with the option of a side bar for additional details, a matrix (With a scroll bar of it's own) would display all the products that we have, in a organized way. 
Clicking on the product should open it's product page as a pop-up, with the various details displayed in a readable manner, and a button that adds a copy of that product to the shopping cart (If a user), or that allows adding a discount (If a worker) 
The list itself should be dynamic, but should be presented in rows of 4 items each, from left to right. If incomplete one way or another, it should follow that pattern
