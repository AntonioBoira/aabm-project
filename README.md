This is the proper start of the repo itself, and the main focus of it!
So Welcome, and please do read thoroughly; 

# The program itself
Right now and at the moment it's far more a proof of concept than it is a finished product on it's own; 
As we did lack pushing on from enough members of the team where finishing it fully was unviable, we focused
on getting the paperwork and everything done properly. 

It's supposed to work via a javacc interface that would be called as a desktop program, that connects to a clouded SQL database, 
which would be secured against MITM attacks; but we had to work off of our own computers, so we were slightly unable to do so. 

Special thanks to Benu for being the backbone of this project and helping us push through so much. 

# The Database

Coded fully by Antonio, it's the entire backend of the project, a SQL database that would hold onto every user account, order, discount, product, location of product, store, and employee. 
A comprehensive database that would allow for the easy updating of the storefront in real time. Issues do arise with mixing different programming approaches, and using Java and SQL together.
But those issues are very much worth the trouble, given the impressive results in computational time that they bring.
